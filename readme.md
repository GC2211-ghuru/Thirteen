## 🛠️ How Thirteen Works

Thirteen is built as a set of pre-written code included in your projects. It acts mainly as an interface to the computer’s basic graphics functions, without loading extra software or libraries.

Since it is “header only,” it means you just need to include a small file in your project to start using it. This reduces complexity and makes it easy to try out or embed in other programs.

The style of graphics it supports focuses on pixel art, simple shapes, and color blocks. This fits well with classic game styles, old demos, or any creative project where you want that vintage look.
